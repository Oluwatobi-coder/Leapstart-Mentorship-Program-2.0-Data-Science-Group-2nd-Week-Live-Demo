# Data Science Mentorship Program - Week 2 Live Demo

A hands-on demonstration of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the Adult Income Prediction dataset. 
This project serves as a training material for the program participants.

## üìú About The Project

This repository contains the code and data for our Week 2 live session. The goal of this demo is to walk through the essential steps of EDA, including:
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
* Identifying patterns and correlations
* Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

---

## üíª Technologies Used

This project was developed using Python and several key data science libraries:

* **Python 3.12+**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** For high-level statistical data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** As the development environment.

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the **Adult Income Prediction Dataset** from the Kaggle Website. The dataset contains 15 features which provides demograhic, employment and income information on individuals captured in the 1994 U.S. Census.

* **Source:** [Kaggle: Adult Income Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mosapabdelghany/adult-income-prediction-dataset?select=adult.csv)
* A copy of the dataset (`adult.csv`) is included in the `/data` directory for convenience.
